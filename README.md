The function maps a colour pallete to a non linear distribution

## ColouRMap    
Input:  
n = number of colours to output   
val = the values on which to map (vector, matrix, dataframe)  
pal = a pallete (default is spectral)  
  
Ouput:  
vector of colours in Hex  

## ColouRMapPlot 
Dependencies:  
ggplot, gridExtra  
  
Input:  
val = distribution (vector, matrix, dataframe)  
pal = a pallete (default is spectral)  
  
Output:  
plot palete mapped on density and values of data
