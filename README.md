The function maps a colour pallete to a non linear distribution

## ColouRMap    
Input:  
n = number of colours to output   
val = the values on which to map (vector, matrix, dataframe)  
pal = a pallete (default is spectral)  
Ouput:  
vector of colours in Hex  

## ColouRMapPlot  
Input:  
val = distribution (vector, matrix, dataframe)  
pal = a pallete (default is spectral)  
Output: density and values of set of values
